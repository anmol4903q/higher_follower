# 🔢 Higher Followers - Instagram Game

Welcome to **Higher Followers**, a simple and fun Python game where you guess which celebrity or brand has more followers on Instagram! 🎯📸

## 📜 About the Project

This project is a console-based game inspired by the famous *Higher or Lower* format. You're given two accounts, and you must guess which one has more followers. If you guess correctly, your score increases and you continue. One wrong guess... and it's game over! ❌

## 👨‍💻 My Learning Journey

This project was more than just writing code — it was about **learning from mistakes** and **improving through practice**.

- It took me **3 attempts** to make this project work fully.
- I faced bugs in score tracking and the comparison logic.
- I also learned how to improve code structure and reusability.
- Most importantly, I’ve learned that debugging and failing is **part of the process** — and I won’t repeat the same mistakes again.

This version is clean, readable, and functional — and I’m proud of it. ✅

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Run the game using any Python IDE or terminal.
2. Two Instagram accounts will be shown.
3. Guess who has more followers by entering `A` or `B`.
4. Get it right? Your score increases and the winner continues.
5. Get it wrong? The game ends and your final score is shown.

Mistakes are proof that you’re trying.  
Keep building, keep breaking, keep fixing.
